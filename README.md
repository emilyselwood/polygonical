# Polygonical

A library for interacting with polygons on a 2d plain.

## Design goals

* Correct
* Safe
* Fast

In that order

## Features

* Points
* Polygons
* Bounding boxes
* Translations of points
* Polygons contain points
* Polygon is_self_intersecting
* Polygon area
* Translations of polygons

## Wanted Features

Things we want to implement but haven't yet.

* Rotations of points
* Rotations of polygons
* Scale of points
* Scale of polygons
* Overlap detection
* Contains detection
* Polygon unions
* Polygon subtraction


## Unwanted Features

Things this library won't do.

* 3d Geometry
* Output to things like svg (that is for another library)
* Coordinate system transforms, epsg codes, pixel space to world space etc.
